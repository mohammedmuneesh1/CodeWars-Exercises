syntax:
/pattern/flags

1) regular expression enclosed between / and /
2)^ starts of the line with must string  otherwise it will return false if we give number as starting 
3)s? it helps to match http and https so if s exist then takes it . kind of optional
4) in regex we use [] for defining character class example "The-stealth_king"--> Thestealthking . we use str.replace(/[-_]/g,"")
